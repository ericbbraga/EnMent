# EnMent

Try to imagine how much emotions your friends and family have shared with you on the trips and places they have visited during the last 30 minutes or in the last few hours or maybe in recent years. Have you stopped to think that these experiences may have been shared so that you could also experience them and the places where they were could be accessed and explored by you?

The Enment application (which means ENjoy the moMENT) wants to bring you a new experience of sharing these moments, where each moment can be replicated or expanded, taking into account your personal taste, creating moments to enjoy and share.

The application will be written sonely in Java Programming Language, using the IDE Android Studio and some libraries to help the development (as Dagger, Glide and so)
